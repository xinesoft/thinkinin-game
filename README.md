# Thinkin'in

My very first game (created in 2007), also my first time using python (I haven't used it again).

It was developed using python2.4 and pygame.
I had to port it to python3, but only a few changes were needed.

## dependencies

python
pygame

```
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```

## how to run

```sh
./play.sh
```

## pygame M1 issue
